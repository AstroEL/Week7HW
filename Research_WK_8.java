	 * 	Research wild-cards in MySQL and write about why and how they are useful.
	 * 
	 * 	I'm going to rewrite the definition here to help me remember a little better - the two
	 * 	used wild-cards in MySQL are the '%' and the '_'. 
	 * 	These wild-characters can be used with the LIKE operator to substitute any other character
	 * 	into a string. The % represents zero, one, or multiple characters ---- while the _ only
	 * 	represents a single character. 
	 * 
	 * 	These wild-cards can be useful because it makes more specific searching and filtering 
	 * 	possible where specific characters and/or character positions can be pinned and used
	 * 	for changing, organizing or deleting data in the database.
	 * 
	 * 	https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_wildcards.asp
	 *
	 *	Research all the operators that can be used in a SQL WHERE clause. Write what they do.
	 *
	 *	In the SQL Where Clause, these operators help single out data by position in the 
	 *	database for manipulation with boolean statements.
	 *				= 		Equals
	 *				<>		Not Equal (could be ! in some versions of SQL)
	 *				>		Greater than
	 *				<		Less than
	 *				>=		Greater than or equal
	 *				<=		Less than or equal
	 *				BETWEEN	Identifies the values between an inclusive range
	 *				LIKE	Search for a pattern - can use wild-cards (%_) 
	 *				IN		To specify multiple possible values for a column -  I had
	 *						to dig around on the web to find this out for the last question in the
	 *						coding portion... I should really do the research portion first, 
	 *						it would have saved some time.
